# **Chatbot**

A chatbot is a computer program that understands the intent of your query to answer with a solution. Chatbots are the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing in the industry.

## **End-to-End Chatbot** 

An end-to-end chatbot refers to a chatbot that can handle a complete conversation from start to finish without requiring human assistance. To create an end-to-end chatbot, you need to write a computer program that can understand user requests, generate appropriate responses, and take action when necessary. This involves collecting data, choosing a programming language and NLP tools, training the chatbot, and testing and refining it before making it available to users. 

Once deployed, users can interact with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and the chatbot can handle the entire conversation itself.

## Steps to create End-to-End chatbot

In this project, to create an end-to-end chatbot, the following steps are adapted using Python:

* Define Intents
* Create training data
* Train the chatbot
* Build the chatbot
* Test the chatbot
* Deploy the chatbot
